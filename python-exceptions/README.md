In Python, exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program and disrupt the normal flow of execution.
 When an exception occurs, the program halts at the point where the error occurred and looks for a block of code that can handle that exception.

Exceptions allow for the controlled capture and handling of errors, preventing the program from crashing completely. 
Upon detecting an exception, Python can execute specialized code to handle it and provide useful information about the error.

Some common examples of exceptions in Python are:

TypeError: Occurs when an operation is performed on an object of the wrong type.
ValueError: Raised when an argument has an inappropriate value passed to a function.
ZeroDivisionError: Happens when an attempt is made to divide a number by zero.
FileNotFoundError: Raised when trying to access a file that doesn't exist.
To handle an exception, the try-except control structure is used.
 The code that may raise an exception is placed within the try block,
 and any exception that occurs is caught in the except block, where code to handle the specific exception is defined.

Here's a basic example of how exception handling is used:

try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # Code to handle the ZeroDivisionError exception
    print("Error: Division by zero")

In this example, if we attempt to perform the division 10 / 0, a
 ZeroDivisionError exception is raised. The program captures this exception
 in the corresponding except block and displays an error message instead, preventing the program from crashing abruptly.
